<h1 class="title toc-ignore">R and the NetCDF library</h1>
<h4 class="author">Michael D. Sumner</h4>

<p>This package <code>ncdump</code> was an early attempt to support a
tidyverse-inspired package for R.</p>
<p>The key idea is to integrate interactive exploration of what is in
the source with lazy-specification of subset requests - so that a
<em>user or developer</em> gets helpers that show:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data available in variables, and how they relate to each other
structurally</li>
<li>the structural array axes available for “slicing”</li>
<li>the impact of coordinate- or index-based filter-expressions using
dplyr idioms</li>
<li>the indexes that the raw API understands for a given slice.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would provide facility for any data-read to be “lazy”, delayed
until the last moment at which the choice of output form is made
(long-form data frame, raw array, bespoke format such as
<code>raster</code>, <code>image</code>, streaming to another service
on-demand etc.).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ropensci/tidync" class="uri">https://github.com/ropensci/tidync</a></p>
<p>This work needed a systematic “metadata-extraction” language, and
currently <code>ncmeta</code>/<code>tidync</code> are the core of that,
wrapping <code>ncdf4</code> and <code>RNetCDF</code> and other
exploratory wrappings of <code>rhdf5</code> and <code>rgdal</code> for
other cases.</p>
<p>Some poor choices were made in an early version “ncdump” on CRAN
(basically class “NetCDF” already used by <code>RNetCDF</code>), and so
current direction involves streamlining <code>ncdump</code> with
<code>ncmeta</code> then getting the <code>tidync</code> package onto
CRAN. The partial visibility of groups had also obscured what these
packages were enabling and the required insights to transcend the format
details in specific cases.</p>
<div id="why-so-many-netcdf-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Why so many NetCDF packages?</h1>
<p>Support in R for NetCDF is piecemeal and fragmented. The following
sections describe the various facilities of this format and the patchy
suppport for them in various R packages.</p>
<p>NetCDF had very large breaking-change update in the move from version
3 to version 4.</p>
<div id="netcdf-classic-version-3" class="section level2">
<h2>NetCDF classic (version 3)</h2>
<p>The “original” format of NetCDF was pretty straightforward. A source
could have variables, dimensions and attributes. This is well supported
by <code>RNetCDF</code> and <code>ncdf4</code> on CRAN, both of which
are provided for multiple architectures (Windows and MacOS). This was
also supported by <code>ncdf</code>, but that was superseded by
<code>ncdf4</code> (by the same author) and <code>ncdf</code> is now
removed from CRAN (end of 2015).</p>
<p>When <code>ncdf</code> was removed from CRAN the <code>raster</code>
package also updated and removed its references to that package. It had
previously used <code>ncdf4</code> in preference, deferring to
<code>ncdf</code> when required i.e. on Windows.</p>
<p>The <code>rgdal</code> package can include the NetCDF library as a
driver, but no CRAN build has ever done so. Unlike <code>raster</code>
the use of the NetCDF library by GDAL is independent of these other R
packages, and users are expected to build it in if it’s required (true
for many other drivers).</p>
<p>The relationship between <code>raster</code> and <code>rgdal</code>
is a little complex, since <code>raster</code> has an independent
interpretation of these sources that uses <code>ncdf4</code> directly,
but after checking and failing for its own support for a read
<code>raster</code> will fall back and see if <code>rgdal</code> can
provide read from a source - but the user cannot request that raster go
via rgdal without masking the <code>ncdf4</code> package visibility. The
model interpretation provided by <code>raster</code> and
<code>rgdal</code> is analogous, but different and independent. They may
“fail to support” a given source for the same broad reason, but the
details can be very different.</p>
</div>
<div id="netcdf-modern-version-4" class="section level2">
<h2>NetCDF modern (version 4)</h2>
<p>This was a complex update to NetCDF, essentially a re-engineering of
the library from HDF5. It enabled a number of new facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>groups (hierarchical structure within a source, like a file system -
directories of variables)</li>
<li>internal compression</li>
<li>“chunking” (i.e. multi-dimensional tiling, the layout on disk of the
values relative to the logical layout of the array)</li>
<li>compound types (struct-like custom data types, commonly used to
approximate “tables” i.e. sets of same-length-different-type 1-D
arrays)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ncdf4</code> package in its original form supported all of
these new features except for compound types, and it also supports the
classic “version 3” forms.</p>
<p>Both <code>raster</code> and <code>rgdal</code> support NetCDF in all
cases above for NetCDF version 4 apart from compound types. The
specification of a source within groups is quite specific though and
there’s little exercise of how these packages relate to them. Neither
support “non-regular” non-affine-based georeferencing - both rely on the
rectilinear-axes-coordinate model used by NetCDF being
degenerate-rectilinear - but again the heuristics applied are different
for different sources and so this is a complex area to summarize.</p>
<p>The <code>rhdf5</code> package supports NetCDF version 4 including
compound types. Specifically, it has a straightforward way to read these
as data frames when it makes sense to do so. There’s no limit on what
NetCDF version 4 can be read, but the interpretation is very much
lower-level than either <code>raster</code> or <code>rgdal</code>. This
package is on Bioconductor, so it obscure to the normal CRAN user but it
is supported cross platform. <code>rhdf5</code> cannot read the classic
form NetCDF version 3 format.</p>
</div>
<div id="dods-opendap-thredds" class="section level2">
<h2>DODS, OpenDAP, Thredds</h2>
<p>(DODS is the old system, sequentially replaced by OpenDAP and now
Thredds - these are synonymous terms as far as I know, but “DODS” is the
name of the GDAL driver, for raster and vector sources).</p>
<p>The NetCDF driver can be OpenDAP-aware. The missing OpenDAP support
for Windows / MacOS is a lower level shared library issue that is a
problem with the Windows ncdf4 and RNetCDF packages as well.</p>
<p>GDAL has an independent driver DODS, but NetCDF itself can also be
DODS/OpenDAP capable. Similar overlap occurs with NetCDF(4) and HDF5,
and you can see conflicts with raw HTTP sources and these
DODS/OpenDAP/Thredds sources because the “same syntax” triggers
driver-choice on connect. All driver conflicts within a given GDAL build
can be resolved by prepending the driver identifier to the data source
string, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Both <code>RNetCDF</code> and <code>ncdf4</code> support these server
systems when the library is configured for its support (so usually only
Linux users who can install the requirements). NetCDF can be installed
from source and configured with these options, or installed from distros
- essentially the unstable-ubuntu-gis stack + libdnetcdf-dev is the
simplest way.</p>
</div>
<div id="groups-are-partly-why-this-is-so-confusing" class="section level2">
<h2>Groups are partly why this is so confusing</h2>
<p><em>Groups</em> are a way to add an extra level to collections of
variables within a single data source. It’s like a “group” allows a file
to contain more than one file, where “file” corresponds to an available
set of dimensions.</p>
<p>Both <code>RNetCDF</code> and <code>ncdf4</code> support groups
<strong>but</strong> neither will list the contents of any group that
contains compound types, so we don’t notice at the R level that the
groups with those types are silently ignored - unless they are the only
type in the file - and we notice because it simply fails to work at
all.</p>
<p>NOTE: I am referring to the current CRAN version of RNetCDF 1.8-2 -
the development version on R-forge already has new support for version
4.0 and groups. (that was from 2017).</p>
<p>RNetCDF source now lives here: <a href="https://github.com/mjwoods/RNetCDF" class="uri">https://github.com/mjwoods/RNetCDF</a></p>
<p>Supporting groups in full requires a re-write, a super-package to
transcend <code>ncdf4</code>, <code>RNetCDF</code> and
<code>rhdf5</code> - wrappers at the R level could drive these for a
virtual super-package, but it’s complicated by the cross-platform
problems.</p>
<p>Ultimately groups provide a nice analogy for dealing with <em>sets of
files</em>, which is a standard model for long-running observations or
large model output with long temporal axes. Dealing with this level of
hierarchy will enable a true abstraction over these file system
artefacts and provide a proper virtual array with database-like
support.</p>
